# README OF THE APP

This is my repository of my GifExpertApp

## How to use it

Use the input to search something you want to watch as a gif, for example:

```bash
Google
```

And if you want to download the node_modules package, just write: 

```bash
yarn install
```
in the terminal to install the node_modules.

## Suggestions
If you want to suggest something, just send me a message.
